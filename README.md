Third face that I have created for my garmin venu plus 2. This watch face, I believe, looks a bit more modern. It has the following: 

- a modern background with placeholder to show various data fieldsa low poly alpine background
- digital time at the center
- steps, climbs, date, and hr on specific placeholders

# Getting Started With Development
- Install the Garmin SDK from garmin website: https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/
- Make sure that necessary SDK is set as the **current sdk (4.2.0)** at the time of writing this document and watch face.  
- Make sure that you have Visual Studio Code Installed with the Monkey C extension from Garmin.
- Open Ctrl + SHIFT + P to open the command palette and run "monkeyc.verifyInstallation" to validate the installation (you might have to link the SDK installation path).
- If everything checks out, you should be able to hit F5 to run the app in a simulator.
- Additionally, you will need the BM Font Tool to create .fnt file from any custom ttf font files. You can download this tool from: http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/. Your settings should look something like this for the fnt to work as expected.
